Package **flowtuple** reads binary flowtuple files in Go.  The flowtuple file format
is documented [here](http://www.caida.org/tools/measurement/corsaro/docs/formats.html#formats_ft).

To run the test script, download the "example.flowtuple.cors.gz" file
from [here](http://www.caida.org/home/how-to/telescope-patch-tuesday).
